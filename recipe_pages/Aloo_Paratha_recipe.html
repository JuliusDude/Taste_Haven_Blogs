                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preparation</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Boil potatoes just until fork tender without making them mushy. To pressure cook in traditional cooker, cook for 3 to 4 whistles depending on the size of potatoes. In instant pot, pressure cook for 5 mins for medium potatoes.</li>
                            <li>While the potatoes boil, make the dough. Add flour, oil and salt to a bowl. Pour half cup water and begin to mix to form a dough. Pour more water as needed and make a soft yet non-sticky dough.</li>
                            <li>Knead it well until soft &amp; pliable. If you press down the dough with your finger, it should dent easily. Cover and rest until the filling is ready.</li>
                            <li>When the potatoes are done, cool them slightly and peel while still warm. Ensure your boiled potatoes are not mushy or soggy.</li>
                            <li>Grate or mash them well until no bits of potatoes remain. Using your fingers, break any chunks left in the mash. Do not over mash as potatoes will turn pasty and sticky.</li>
                            <li>Add ginger, green chilies, coriander leaves, salt, red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder, kasuri methi and chaat masala. Crush the kasuri methi before adding.</li>
                            <li>Optional: Also add ajwain and fennel powder if using.</li>
                            <li>Mix all ingredients gently and taste test. Add more salt or spices as needed.</li>
                            <li>Divide the aloo stuffing into 8 parts. Also divide the dough into 8 parts. Keep the dough covered.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>How to Make Aloo Paratha</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Roll a dough ball in your palms to smooth. Lightly sprinkle some flour on the rolling area. Flatten the dough ball and dip it in some flour.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Method 1:</strong> Dust off excess flour &amp; roll to a 4 inch disc. Place a portion of aloo stuffing in the center. Gently bring the sides up shaping like a cup. Push the stuffing inside with your finger and bring the dough up until the edges come over the stuffing.
                            </li>
                            <li>If the stuffing is sticky, dip your fingers in flour. Bring the edges together over the stuffing and join to seal carefully.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Method 2:</strong> Roll a 5 inch roti and place the stuffing in the center, hold the edges and make small pleats. Bring all on top and join to seal. Remove excess dough on top.
                            </li>
                            <li>Dip the stuffed ball in flour and flatten gently to spread the stuffing evenly. Dust off excess flour.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle some flour on the rolling area.</li>
                            <li>Place the paratha disc on the rolling area with the sealed side down. Begin to roll evenly all over without putting pressure.</li>
                            <li>Do not roll continuously. Rotate a little after every 4 to 6 rolls to avoid tearing or sticking. Sprinkle flour as needed but avoid excess. If stuffing comes out, gently apply some flour to seal.</li>
                            <li>Roll the aloo paratha as thin or thick as you like without tearing. Typically 8 to 9 inches.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the rolled ones to a dry area. Once you are done with 3, you can begin to fry them.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Method 3:</strong> For 6 large parathas, divide dough into 12 and stuffing into 6 parts. Roll 2 rotis of 6 inches each. Spread aloo mixture on one roti. Wet edges with water. Place the other roti on top. Press down gently on sides to seal. Sprinkle flour and roll evenly.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Frying</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat a pan or griddle. It should be hot enough or parathas will turn hard.</li>
                            <li>When hot, gently transfer a rolled aloo paratha to it.</li>
                            <li>Within 2 to 3 mins, bubbles will appear. Flip to the other side and cook.</li>
                            <li>When the paratha puffs and cooks well, drizzle ghee or oil all over and flip again.</li>
                            <li>Smear some ghee on this side as well and press down the edges to cook thoroughly.</li>
                            <li>When golden to light brown spots appear, remove to a plate and stack. This keeps them soft.</li>
                            <li>Top with butter and serve with pickle or yogurt. Coriander or mint chutney also go well.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
